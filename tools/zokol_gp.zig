// # Sokol GP

// Minimal efficient cross platform 2D graphics painter in pure C
// using modern graphics API through the excellent [Sokol GFX](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) library.

// Sokol GP, or in short SGP, stands for Sokol Graphics Painter.

// ![sample-primitives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubart/sokol_gp/master/screenshots/sample-primitives.png)

// ## Features

// * Made and optimized only for **2D rendering only**, no 3D support.
// * Minimal, in a pure single C header.
// * Use modern unfixed pipeline graphics APIs for more efficiency.
// * Cross platform (backed by Sokol GFX).
// * D3D11/OpenGL 3.3/Metal/WebGPU graphics backends (through Sokol GFX).
// * **Automatic batching** (merge recent draw calls into batches automatically).
// * **Batch optimizer** (rearranges the ordering of draw calls to batch more).
// * Uses preallocated memory (no allocations at runtime).
// * Supports drawing basic 2D primitives (rectangles, triangles, lines and points).
// * Supports the classic 2D color blending modes (color blend, add, modulate, multiply).
// * Supports 2D space transformations and changing 2D space coordinate systems.
// * Supports drawing the basic primitives (rectangles, triangles, lines and points).
// * Supports multiple texture bindings.
// * Supports custom fragment shaders with 2D primitives.
// * Can be mixed with projects that are already using Sokol GFX.

// ## Why?

// Sokol GFX is an excellent library for rendering using unfixed pipelines
// of modern graphics cards, but it is too complex to use for simple 2D drawing,
// and it's API is too generic and specialized for 3D rendering. To draw 2D stuff, the programmer
// usually needs to setup custom shaders when using Sokol GFX, or use its Sokol GL
// extra library, but Sokol GL also has an API with 3D design in mind, which
// incurs some costs and limitations.

// This library was created to draw 2D primitives through Sokol GFX with ease,
// and by not considering 3D usage it is optimized for 2D rendering only,
// furthermore it features an **automatic batch optimizer**, more details of it will be described below.

// ## Automatic batch optimizer

// When drawing the library creates a draw command queue of all primitives yet to be drawn,
// every time a new draw command is added the batch optimizer looks back up to the last
// 8 recent draw commands (this is adjustable), and try to rearrange and merge drawing commands
// if it finds a previous draw command that meets the following criteria:

// * The new draw command and previous command uses the *same primitive pipeline*
// * The new draw command and previous command uses the *same shader uniforms*
// * The new draw command and previous command uses the *same texture bindings*
// * The new draw command and previous command does not have another intermediary
// draw command *that overlaps* in-between them.

// By doing this the batch optimizer is able for example to merge textured draw calls,
// even if they were drawn with other intermediary different textures draws between them.
// The effect is more efficiency when drawing, because less draw calls will be dispatched
// to the GPU,

// This library can avoid a lot of work of making an efficient 2D drawing batching system,
// by automatically merging draw calls behind the scenes at runtime,
// thus the programmer does not need to manage batched draw calls manually,
// nor he needs to sort batched texture draw calls,
// the library will do this seamlessly behind the scenes.

// The batching algorithm is fast, but it has `O(n)` CPU complexity for every new draw command added,
// where `n` is the `SGP_BATCH_OPTIMIZER_DEPTH` configuration.
// In experiments using `8` as the default is a good default,
// but you may want to try out different values depending on your case.
// Using values that are too high is not recommended, because the algorithm may take too long
// scanning previous draw commands, and that may consume more CPU resources.

// The batch optimizer can be disabled by setting `SGP_BATCH_OPTIMIZER_DEPTH` to 0,
// you can use that to measure its impact.

// In the samples directory of this repository there is a
// benchmark example that tests drawing with the bath optimizer enabled/disabled.
// On my machine that benchmark was able to increase performance in a 2.2x factor when it is enabled.
// In some private game projects the gains of the batch optimizer proved to increase FPS performance
// above 1.5x by just replacing the graphics backend with this library, with no internal
// changes to the game itself.

// ## Design choices

// The library has some design choices with performance in mind that will be discussed briefly here.

// Like Sokol GFX, Sokol GP will never do any allocation in the draw loop,
// so when initializing you must configure beforehand the maximum size of the
// draw command queue buffer and the vertices buffer.

// All the 2D space transformation (functions like `sgp_rotate`) are done by the CPU and not by the GPU,
// this is intentionally to avoid adding extra overhead in the GPU, because typically the number
// of vertices of 2D applications are not that large, and it is more efficient to perform
// all the transformation with the CPU right away rather than pushing extra buffers to the GPU
// that ends up using more bandwidth of the CPU<->GPU bus.
// In contrast 3D applications usually dispatches vertex transformations to the GPU using a vertex shader,
// they do this because the amount of vertices of 3D objects can be very large
// and it is usually the best choice, but this is not true for 2D rendering.

// Many APIs to transform the 2D space before drawing a primitive are available, such as
// translate, rotate and scale. They can be used as similarly as the ones available in 3D graphics APIs,
// but they are crafted for 2D only, for example when using 2D we don't need to use a 4x4 or 3x3 matrix
// to perform vertex transformation, instead the code is specialized for 2D and can use a 2x3 matrix,
// saving extra CPU float computations.

// All pipelines always use a texture associated with it, even when drawing non textured primitives,
// because this minimizes graphics pipeline changes when mixing textured calls and non textured calls,
// improving efficiency.

// The library is coded in the style of Sokol GFX headers, reusing many macros from there,
// you can change some of its semantics such as custom allocator, custom log function, and some
// other details, read `sokol_gfx.h` documentation for more on that.

// ## Usage

// Copy `sokol_gp.h` along with other Sokol headers to the same folder. Setup Sokol GFX
// as you usually would, then add call to `sgp_setup(desc)` just after `sg_setup(desc)`, and
// call to `sgp_shutdown()` just before `sg_shutdown()`. Note that you should usually check if
// SGP is valid after its creation with `sgp_is_valid()` and exit gracefully with an error if not.

// In your frame draw function add `sgp_begin(width, height)` before calling any SGP
// draw function, then draw your primitives. At the end of the frame (or framebuffer) you
// should **ALWAYS call** `sgp_flush()` between a Sokol GFX begin/end render pass,
// the `sgp_flush()` will dispatch all draw commands to Sokol GFX. Then call `sgp_end()` immediately
// to discard the draw command queue.

// An actual example of this setup will be shown below.

// ## Quick usage example

// The following is a quick example on how to this library with Sokol GFX and Sokol APP:

// ```c
// // This is an example on how to set up and use Sokol GP to draw a filled rectangle.

// // Includes Sokol GFX, Sokol GP and Sokol APP, doing all implementations.
// #define SOKOL_IMPL
// #include "sokol_gfx.h"
// #include "sokol_gp.h"
// #include "sokol_app.h"
// #include "sokol_glue.h"
// #include "sokol_log.h"

// #include <stdio.h> // for fprintf()
// #include <stdlib.h> // for exit()
// #include <math.h> // for sinf() and cosf()

// // Called on every frame of the application.
// static void frame(void) {
//     // Get current window size.
//     int width = sapp_width(), height = sapp_height();
//     float ratio = width/(float)height;

//     // Begin recording draw commands for a frame buffer of size (width, height).
//     sgp_begin(width, height);
//     // Set frame buffer drawing region to (0,0,width,height).
//     sgp_viewport(0, 0, width, height);
//     // Set drawing coordinate space to (left=-ratio, right=ratio, top=1, bottom=-1).
//     sgp_project(-ratio, ratio, 1.0f, -1.0f);

//     // Clear the frame buffer.
//     sgp_set_color(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f);
//     sgp_clear();

//     // Draw an animated rectangle that rotates and changes its colors.
//     float time = sapp_frame_count() * sapp_frame_duration();
//     float r = sinf(time)*0.5+0.5, g = cosf(time)*0.5+0.5;
//     sgp_set_color(r, g, 0.3f, 1.0f);
//     sgp_rotate_at(time, 0.0f, 0.0f);
//     sgp_draw_filled_rect(-0.5f, -0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

//     // Begin a render pass.
//     sg_pass pass = {.swapchain = sglue_swapchain()};
//     sg_begin_pass(&pass);
//     // Dispatch all draw commands to Sokol GFX.
//     sgp_flush();
//     // Finish a draw command queue, clearing it.
//     sgp_end();
//     // End render pass.
//     sg_end_pass();
//     // Commit Sokol render.
//     sg_commit();
// }

// // Called when the application is initializing.
// static void init(void) {
//     // Initialize Sokol GFX.
//     sg_desc sgdesc = {
//         .environment = sglue_environment(),
//         .logger.func = slog_func
//     };
//     sg_setup(&sgdesc);
//     if (!sg_isvalid()) {
//         fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create Sokol GFX context!\n");
//         exit(-1);
//     }

//     // Initialize Sokol GP, adjust the size of command buffers for your own use.
//     sgp_desc sgpdesc = {0};
//     sgp_setup(&sgpdesc);
//     if (!sgp_is_valid()) {
//         fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create Sokol GP context: %s\n", sgp_get_error_message(sgp_get_last_error()));
//         exit(-1);
//     }
// }

// // Called when the application is shutting down.
// static void cleanup(void) {
//     // Cleanup Sokol GP and Sokol GFX resources.
//     sgp_shutdown();
//     sg_shutdown();
// }

// // Implement application main through Sokol APP.
// sapp_desc sokol_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
//     (void)argc;
//     (void)argv;
//     return (sapp_desc){
//         .init_cb = init,
//         .frame_cb = frame,
//         .cleanup_cb = cleanup,
//         .window_title = "Rectangle (Sokol GP)",
//         .logger.func = slog_func,
//     };
// }
// ```

// To run this example, first copy the `sokol_gp.h` header alongside with other Sokol headers
// to the same folder, then compile with any C compiler using the proper linking flags (read `sokol_gfx.h`).

// * [sample-bench.c](https://github.com/edubart/sokol_gp/blob/master/samples/sample-bench.c): This is a heavy example used for benchmarking purposes.

// These examples are used as the test suite for the library, you can build them by typing `make`.

// ## Error handling

// It is possible that after many draw calls the command or vertex buffer may overflow,
// in that case the library will set an error error state and will continue to operate normally,
// but when flushing the drawing command queue with `sgp_flush()` no draw command will be dispatched.
// This can happen because the library uses pre allocated buffers, in such
// cases the issue can be fixed by increasing the prefixed command queue buffer and the vertices buffer
// when calling `sgp_setup()`.

// Making invalid number of push/pops of `sgp_push_transform()` and `sgp_pop_transform()`,
// or nesting too many `sgp_begin()` and `sgp_end()` may also lead to errors, that
// is a usage mistake.

// ## Blend modes

// The library supports the most usual blend modes used in 2D, which are the following:

// - `SGP_BLENDMODE_NONE` - No blending (`dstRGBA = srcRGBA`).
// - `SGP_BLENDMODE_BLEND` - Alpha blending (`dstRGB = (srcRGB * srcA) + (dstRGB * (1-srcA))` and `dstA = srcA + (dstA * (1-srcA))`)
// - `SGP_BLENDMODE_ADD` - Color add (`dstRGB = (srcRGB * srcA) + dstRGB` and `dstA = dstA`)
// - `SGP_BLENDMODE_MOD` - Color modulate (`dstRGB = srcRGB * dstRGB` and `dstA = dstA`)
// - `SGP_BLENDMODE_MUL` - Color multiply (`dstRGB = (srcRGB * dstRGB) + (dstRGB * (1-srcA))` and `dstA = (srcA * dstA) + (dstA * (1-srcA))`)

// ## Changing 2D coordinate system

// You can change the screen area to draw by calling `sgp_viewport(x, y, width, height)`.
// You can change the coordinate system of the 2D space by calling `sgp_project(left, right, top, bottom)`,
// with it.

// ## Transforming 2D space

// You can translate, rotate or scale the 2D space before a draw call, by using the transformation
// functions the library provides, such as `sgp_translate(x, y)`, `sgp_rotate(theta)`, etc.
// Check the cheat sheet or the header for more.

// To save and restore the transformation state you should call `sgp_push_transform()` and
// later `sgp_pop_transform()`.

// ## Drawing primitives

// The library provides drawing functions for all the basic primitives, that is,
// for points, lines, triangles and rectangles, such as `sgp_draw_line()` and `sgp_draw_filled_rect()`.
// Check the cheat sheet or the header for more.
// All of them have batched variations.

// ## Drawing textured primitives

// To draw textured rectangles you can use `sgp_set_image(0, img)` and then sgp_draw_filled_rect()`,
// this will draw an entire texture into a rectangle.
// You should later reset the image with `sgp_reset_image(0)` to restore the bound image to default white image,
// otherwise you will have glitches when drawing a solid color.

// In case you want to draw a specific source from the texture,
// you should use `sgp_draw_textured_rect()` instead.

// By default textures are drawn using a simple nearest filter sampler,
// you can change the sampler with `sgp_set_sampler(0, smp)` before drawing a texture,
// it's recommended to restore the default sampler using `sgp_reset_sampler(0)`.

// ## Color modulation

// All common pipelines have color modulation, and you can modulate
// a color before a draw by setting the current state color with `sgp_set_color(r,g,b,a)`,
// later you should reset the color to default (white) with `sgp_reset_color()`.

// ## Custom shaders

// When using a custom shader, you must create a pipeline for it with `sgp_make_pipeline(desc)`,
// using shader, blend mode and a draw primitive associated with it. Then you should
// call `sgp_set_pipeline()` before the shader draw call. You are responsible for using
// the same blend mode and drawing primitive as the created pipeline.

// Custom uniforms can be passed to the shader with `sgp_set_uniform(data, size)`,
// where you should always pass a pointer to a struct with exactly the same schema and size
// as the one defined in the shader.

// Although you can create custom shaders for each graphics backend manually,
// it is advised should use the Sokol shader compiler [SHDC](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md),
// because it can generate shaders for multiple backends from a single `.glsl` file,
// and this usually works well.

// By default the library uniform buffer per draw call has just 4 float uniforms
// (`SGP_UNIFORM_CONTENT_SLOTS` configuration), and that may be too low to use with custom shaders.
// This is the default because typically newcomers may not want to use custom 2D shaders,
// and increasing a larger value means more overhead.
// If you are using custom shaders please increase this value to be large enough to hold
// the number of uniforms of your largest shader.

// ## Library configuration

// The following macros can be defined before including to change the library behavior:

// - `SGP_BATCH_OPTIMIZER_DEPTH` - Number of draw commands that the batch optimizer looks back at. Default is 8.
// - `SGP_UNIFORM_CONTENT_SLOTS` - Maximum number of floats that can be stored in each draw call uniform buffer. Default is 4.
// - `SGP_TEXTURE_SLOTS` - Maximum number of textures that can be bound per draw call. Default is 4.

// ## License

// MIT, see LICENSE file or the end of `sokol_gp.h` file.


// Number of draw commands that the batch optimizer looks back at.
// 8 is a fair default value, but could be tuned per application.
// 1 makes the batch optimizer try to merge only the very last draw call.
// 0 disables the batch optimizer
const batch_optimizer_depth = 8;

// Number of uniform floats (4-bytes) slots that can be set in a shader.
// Increase this value if you need to use shader with many uniforms.
const uniform_content_slots = 4;

// Number of texture slots that can be bound in a pipeline.
const texture_slots = 4;
